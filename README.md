# Medical Insurance Costs Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this data analysis project was to investigate factors influencing medical insurance costs using a dataset in CSV format. The analysis leveraged Python programming skills to uncover insights and trends within the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains various attributes such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.

## Methods and Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Key Findings

### Gender Analysis
- On average, men pay higher insurance charges than women for similar profiles (age, BMI, number of children):
  - Men: \$13,956.75
  - Women: \$12,569.57

### BMI Analysis
- **Age and BMI**: Older individuals tend to have higher BMI, which in turn increases insurance charges.
- **Smoking and BMI**: Smokers have a higher average BMI compared to non-smokers.
- **Children and BMI**: BMI tends to increase with the number of children.
- **Regional BMI Differences**:
  - Southeast: 33.36
  - Southwest: 30.60
  - Northwest: 29.20
  - Northeast: 29.17

### Charges Analysis
- **Smoking Status**:
  - Non-smokers: \$8,434
  - Smokers: \$32,050
- **Age and Charges**: Insurance charges increase with age:
  - 18 years: ~\$7,000/year
  - 36 years: ~\$12,000/year
  - 60 years: ~\$22,000/year
- **Children and Charges**: Charges peak when individuals have 2 or 3 children (~\$15,000 compared to ~\$12,500 for those with fewer children).
- **Regional Charges**: The Southeast region has the highest charges (\$14,740), correlating with higher BMI scores.

### Smoking Analysis
- The Southeast region has a higher percentage of smokers (25%) compared to the Northwest and Southwest regions (17%), which may contribute to higher insurance charges in that region.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors affecting medical insurance costs, highlighting the impact of age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and regional differences.
